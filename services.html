        <h2>Hi, I’m Eloi</h2>
        <p>A brief introduction to myself</p>
    </header>
    <p align="justify">My name is Eloi Cruz, I'm twenty-four years old and I'm an informatic engenieer by the Facultat Informàtica de Barcelona (UPC). Although my studies have a technical profile, I love to apply my knowledge to solve business problems. Above all, I am passionate about digital transformation and business intelligence. I understand digital transformation as a collection of all the projects involved in the analysis and improvement of a company's processes. The main objective of these projects is to detect inefficiencies and seek solutions that reduce the associated costs and improve the productivity of assets by incorporating new technologies and updating user skills.</p>
    <p align="justify">I would like to emphasise that I enjoy studying supply chain processes related to logistics, such as warehouse management or distribution fleet management. I strongly believe in the FOCA model (facts, opinions, changes and actions) as a suitable model for decision making - it is essential to have the facts (quality data) to be able to make the best possible decisions.</p>
    <p align="justify">My knowledge of information technology allows me to create infrastructures that support the creation of data models and the digitalisation of processes. Furthermore, I am very interested in the Internet of Things, the creation of environments where multiple sources of information have the capacity to communicate in order to transmit data related to the environment. Thanks to the improvement of network infrastructures such as, for example, the creation of 5G, the IoT will increasingly bring more added value to businesses.</p>
