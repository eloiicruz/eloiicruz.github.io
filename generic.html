									<h2 id="ASDT">ASDT Systems Europe</h2>
									<p align="justify">I started my professional career at <a href="https://www.asdt.eu/">ASDT Systems</a>. This is a technology company located in Sallent (Barcelona). Their speciality is the creation of countermeasure systems against unmanned aerial vehicles. The journey I had in the company was very varied. I started in December 2017 with the programming of radio frequency jamming systems and I finished in September 2019 due to the incompatibility of the work with my university studies. Below is a description of the main projects in which I participated and the role I played in each of them. </p>

									<p align="justify">The first project in which I was involved in was the programming of handheld <a href="https://www.asdt.eu/products/sendes-hd03t/">radio frequency jamming equipment</a>. One of the company's most distinctive products was the hand-held jamming gun. These ergonomic devices enabled the targeted jamming of drones. Their main purpose was to enable law enforcement officers to stop potential attacks on critical infrastructure. These systems needed a graphical user interface so that the internal systems could be controlled by the people using the systems. My job was to program the microcontroller that triggered the jamming mechanisms and showed the user the status of the device at any given moment. In addition to the software development work, I was actively involved in the design and assembly of the electronic components that were part of the inhibition actuation and control system.  Some of the metal components of the device needed to be modelled in order to be part of the gun. Another of my tasks, not so much related to software development, was the start-up of a cnc milling machine and the creation of CAM patterns with the designs generated by the mechanical department.</p>
									<p align="justify">Another product we offered was <a href="https://www.asdt.eu/products/sendescope/">stationary detection and automatic inhibition systems</a>. In addition to the jamming technology, these devices also had a real-time drone detection infrastructure. This system was based on DJI's AeroScope device. The combination of the two features offered the possibility of having a portable device that could disable drones automatically and without the need for a law enforcement officer to be present at the time of the hostile aircraft incursion. My task in this product was to connect the dji technology to the sendes ecosystem to enable communication and information transfer between systems.</p>
