									<p align="justify">My interest in technology began in the high school. I took the scientific branch of the course and learnt the basic concepts of mathematics, physics and chemistry. My interest in technology and information systems led me to design and prototype a home automation system for my final project at the end of the second year. With the help of the Arduino programming framework, I designed and programmed a system that included the automation of different systems in a house. These systems were for example lighting control, temperature control and access control. I really enjoyed the learning process that I had to go through to achieve my goal and that made me decide to enrol in a computer engineering degree. </p>
									<p align="justify">I studied a degree in computer engineering at the Facultat d'Inform√†tica de Barcelona (UPC). During the first two years, the subjects I took were the compulsory ones of the degree and common to all students. During those years I learned the main concepts of software engineering, algorithms and programming. Once I finished the compulsory phase I had to choose a speciality. Out of the 5 available specialisations I decided to choose the <strong><a href="https://www.fib.upc.edu/es/estudios/grados/grado-en-ingenieria-informatica/plan-de-estudios/especialidades/tecnologias-de-la-informacion">Information Technology</a></strong> one. There I learnt concepts related to the technical resources that exist to create architectures for data capture and exploitation. However, my work experience at Friman awakened a deep curiosity in the <strong>design and study of information systems</strong> and the application of information technology to <strong>solve business problems</strong>. For this reason, in the last year I completed my technical profile by enrolling in subjects of the <strong><a href="https://www.fib.upc.edu/es/estudios/grados/grado-en-ingenieria-informatica/plan-de-estudios/especialidades/sistemas-de-informacion">Information Systems</a></strong> speciallity to give my career a closer perspective to that of <strong>business management</strong> . </p>
