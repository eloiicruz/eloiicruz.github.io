						<p align="justify">My interest in technology began in the high school. I took the scientific branch of the course and learnt the basic concepts of mathematics, physics and chemistry. My interest in technology and information systems led me to design and prototype a home automation system for my final project at the end of the second year. With the help of the Arduino programming framework, I designed and programmed a system that included the automation of different systems in a house. These systems were for example lighting control, temperature control and access control. I really enjoyed the learning process that I had to go through to achieve my goal and that made me decide to enrol in a computer engineering degree. </p>
						<p align="justify">I studied a degree in computer engineering at the Facultat d'Informàtica de Barcelona (UPC). During the first two years, the subjects I took were the compulsory ones of the degree and common to all students. During those years I learned the main concepts of software engineering, algorithms and programming. Once I finished the compulsory phase I had to choose a speciality. Out of the 5 available specialisations I decided to choose the <strong><a href="https://www.fib.upc.edu/es/estudios/grados/grado-en-ingenieria-informatica/plan-de-estudios/especialidades/tecnologias-de-la-informacion">Information Technology</a></strong> one. There I learnt concepts related to the technical resources that exist to create architectures for data capture and exploitation. However, my work experience at Friman awakened a deep curiosity in the <strong>design and study of information systems</strong> and the application of information technology to <strong>solve business problems</strong>. For this reason, in the last year I completed my technical profile by enrolling in subjects of the <strong><a href="https://www.fib.upc.edu/es/estudios/grados/grado-en-ingenieria-informatica/plan-de-estudios/especialidades/sistemas-de-informacion">Information Systems</a></strong> speciallity to give my career a closer perspective to that of <strong>business management</strong>. I would like to end my presentation by highlighting four projects that I have carried out during my degree and which have been evaluated very positively.</p>
						<p align="justify">First of all, I would like to highlight my final degree project. This project, entitled <i>Loracoin: Towards a blockchain-based platform for managing LoRa devices</i>, consisted of the creation of a fully distributed LoRa device management system based on <strong>Blockchain</strong>. The documentation can be accessed through the following <a href="https://upcommons.upc.edu/handle/2117/363417">link</a>. In my <a href="https://gitlab.fib.upc.edu/eloi.cruz/loracoin">repository</a> on the faculty's git server you can access the <strong> Smart Contract </strong> code that served as the backend of the system to manage resources and access to information. I would like to point out that my work was recognised by the ieee-infocom tribunal and was <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9798276">published</a> as a summary poster.</p>
						<p align="justify">Secondly, I would like to highlight three projects associated with different subjects. One of the most important collaborations was with the oncology research department of the Hospital Clínic in Barcelona, where a project was set up to exploit data related to the incidence of cancer and exposure to certain carcinogens such as Radon. Another interesting project was the creation of E-Bin, in the context of <strong>smart cities and sustainability</strong>, a software capable of collecting information on the state of containers in a city to generate optimal collection routes for trucks and thus reduce the consumption of fossil fuels in large cities. Finally, in the subject of programming projects, I developed with a team of four people a system for generating association rules for information in data bases.</p>
